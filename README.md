Please enter at command line input to generate:

-p = Prime Number                ex: Total num count = 10
-f = Fibonacci Number            ex: Total num count = 10
-e = Euro Million Number         ex: Total lines Num = 10
-m = Multiplication Table        ex: Table num 15x15   15
-r = Roman Numberal              ex: Decimal to Roman  10
-b = Convert file to binary      ex: -b ../text/text.txt
-h = Convert file to Hex         ex: -h ../text/text.txt
-o = Convert file to Octal       ex: -o ../text/text.txt

ie. the syntax should read:

		./genNum_x64_1.0 -r 10
		./genNum_x64_1.0 -o ./text.txt
