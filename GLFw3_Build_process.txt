=================================================================
g++ main.o -o main.exec -lGL -lGLU -lglfw3 -lX11 -lXxf86vm -lXrandr -lpthread -lXi


Now compile using g++ -std=c++11 -c main.cpp - not sure if c++11 is required but I used nullptr so, I needed it... You may need to upgrade your gcc to version 4.7, or the upcoming version 4.8... Info on that here.

Then fix your errors if you typed the program by hand or tried to be "too clever" and something didn't work... Then link it using this monster! g++ main.o -o main.exec -lGL -lGLU -lglfw3 -lX11 -lXxf86vm -lXrandr -lpthread -lXi So you see, in the "install build dependencies" part, you may also want to check you have the GL, GLU, X11 Xxf86vm (whatever that is) Xrandr posix-thread and Xi (whatever that is) development libraries installed also. Maybe update your graphics drivers too, I think GLFW 3 may require OpenGL version 3 or higher? Perhaps someone can confirm that? You may also need to add the linker options -ldl -lXinerama -lXcursor to get it to work correctly if you are getting undefined references to dlclose (credit to @user2255242).


pkg-config --static --libs glfw3
shows me that

-L/usr/local/lib -lglfw3 -lrt -lXrandr -lXinerama -lXi -lXcursor -lGL -lm -ldl -lXrender -ldrm -lXdamage -lX11-xcb -lxcb-glx -lxcb-dri2 -lxcb-dri3 -lxcb-present -lxcb-sync -lxshmfence -lXxf86vm -lXfixes -lXext -lX11 -lpthread -lxcb -lXau -lXdmcp  


Note that you do not need that many -ls if you install glfw with the BUILD_SHARED_LIBS option. (You can enable this option by running ccmake first).

This way sudo make install will install the shared library in /usr/local/lib/libglfw.so. You can then compile the example file with a simple:

g++ main.cpp -L /usr/local/lib/ -lglfw
Then do not forget to add /usr/local/lib/ to the search path for shared libraries before running your program. This can be done using:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
And you can put that in your ~/.bashrc so you don't have to type it all the time.

this solved it to me:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libglfw3
sudo apt-get install libglfw3-dev
